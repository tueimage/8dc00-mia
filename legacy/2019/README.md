# Medical Image Analysis course (8DC00)

This course is a sequel to the second year introductory imaging course. In that course the basic principles of image analysis were covered. In 8DC00 we will concentrate on the more advanced image analysis methods and on how they can be used to tackle clinical problems. Topics covered include image registration, segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis.
