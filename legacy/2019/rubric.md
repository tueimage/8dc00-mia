# Assessment rubric

The following rubric will be used to grade the project work.

Component  | Insufficient | Satisfactory | Excellent
--- | --- | --- | ---
**General** | Poor structure, unclear line of thought, inconsistent referencing, severe grammar mistakes | Legible structure, mostly clear line of thought, consistent referencing, spell-checkers do not detect errors | Excellent structure, easy to follow line of thought
**Introduction** | Does not describe the topic and goal of the project, contains irrelevant information | Clearly describes the topic and goal of the project | Describes a "broad picture" perspective of the project work (e.g. relation to other techniques and clinical applications)
**Methods** | Does not convey understanding of the material, descriptions of methods appear to be copied from another source | Conveys good understanding of the material, descriptions of the theory and methods in own words. Does not contain pieces of code | Conveys excellent level of understanding, makes connections between methods
**Results** | Poor choice of experiments and description, poor presentation of the results of the experiments | Good choice of experiments and description, clear and concise presentation of the results | Extensive set of experiments, excellent presentation of the results
**Discussion** | Repetitive, analysis is missing, missing discussion of strengths and weaknesses | Concise analysis of the results, discussion of strengths and weaknesses | In-depth analysis and discussion of the results, critical tone, summary of gained insights into the methodology, suggestions for further analysis
**Tables and figures** | Inconsistent formatting, not referenced in text, present irrelevant/incorrect information, poor captioning | Consistent formatting, correctly referenced in text, present relevant information, captions contain all necessary information | Excellent formatting, self-contained (can be easily understood on their own)
**Code** | Missing or incomplete code structure, runs with errors, lacks documentation | Self-contained, does not result in errors, contains some documentation, can be easily used to reproduce the reported results | User-friendly, well-structured (good separation of general functionality and experiments), detailed documentation, optimized for speed

The assessment rubric was partially based on the UU Graduate School of Life Sciences writing assignment rubric available [here](http://rubric.gsls-uu.nl/rubrics/rubric-writing-assignment).
