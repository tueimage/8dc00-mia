In these exercises you will first write a Python function that performs image transformation by the inverse mapping method.

    "Transforming an image results to transforming the locations of the image pixels. The most obvious method for transforming an image is to apply the geometric transformation to all pixel locations in an input image (the image that is being transformed) in order to determine where those pixel should be located in the output image (the transformed image) and then \"fill in\" the corresponding intensity values. This approach is called forward mapping and is illustrated in the figure below.\n",

    "The forward mapping method can be problematic as some pixels in the output image might not \"receive\" a value (resulting in gaps), while some pixels might \"receive\" multiple values (resulting in overlaps) from the input image. These problems can be avoided by using an approach called inverse mapping illustrated in the figure below. Inverse mapping works by transforming the locations of the output image back to the original image by applying the inverse of the geometric transformation. The values for the pixels of the transformed image can be obtained by interpolation at the determined location in the original image. This avoids the problem of gaps and multiple values of the forward mapping method.\n",
