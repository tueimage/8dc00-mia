    "# 3. Image similarity metrics\n",
    "Intensity-based image registration techniques calculate the transformation between two images based solely on the image intensities (i.e. selection or determination of corresponding point pairs is not needed as in point-based registration). These techniques rely on image similarity metrics that measure the similarity between two images based on their intensities. Intensity-based image registration usually works by iteratively optimizing such a similarity metric.\n",

    "In this section, you will implement two such image similarity metrics: correlation and mutual information. The computation of the mutual information between two images relies on their joint histogram, so one of the exercises deals with the implementation of this intermediate step. In the project work section you will use the similarity metrics to find the optimal rotation transformation that aligns two images.\n",
