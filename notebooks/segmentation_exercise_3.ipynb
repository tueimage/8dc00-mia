    "For this question we will use the ground-truth segmentations of different subjects as different atlases to do brain/not brain segmentation. Load the labels for subjects 1 to 5 as `labels1` to `labels5` with `create_labels`, which is almost the same as `create_dataset` but here we do not need the features. Subjects 1 to 4 will be training data and subject 5 will be test data. For the exercise we will assume the images are registered to each other, but in practice, you would have to perform registration first. Let's combine the labels and view how the true mask compares to the predicted mask:\n",
