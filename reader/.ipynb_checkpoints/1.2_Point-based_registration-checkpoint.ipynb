    "## 1. Point-based registration (theory)\n",
    "\n",
    "Image registration driven by a reliable (set of) reference point(s) on both the fixed and moving views is referred to as point-based ([Fitzpatrick, J.M., et al. Image registration, chapter 8.3](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.464.5408&rep=rep1&type=pdf)). Selected points in the fixed image that are considered reliable, and are typically called _fiducial points_ or _fiducials_, can be part of two groups of distinguishable features: _intrinsic features_ (anatomical landmarks, such as the intersection of the central sulcus with the midline of the brain), or _extrinsic features_ (implanted markers, e.g. on a head coil). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in landmark-based registration, marker-based registration tends to be more precise due to its independence of anatomical structures which may sometimes be hard to discern. Fiducial points within markers may be produced via automated methods that typically assign location to the centroid of the marker. \n",
    "\n",
    "A perfect fiducial alignment is typically impossible due to multiple reasons. There is always some fiducial localization error of the marker, and misalignments, shifts or distortions of the markers may occur relative to the voxel grid. The aim of fiducial-guided registration is to minimize the variance in the two views. Generally, the effective mean displacement will be smaller in magnitude if the marker is larger (ideally beyond the voxel size) and vice versa. Larger markers spanning more than two voxels can be more accurately localized, thereby improving the registration outcome. Reasons are three-fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the marker is large, the fraction of partially filled voxels within it is lower\n",
    "2. Erroneous shifts are cancelled out when the marker partially fills more voxels\n",
    "3. Noise averaging over a larger number of voxels\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Assuming two images misaligned by translation, a simple registration algorithm that is efficient in this example would consist of these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mark the location of some well discernible features in the fixed image\n",
    "- Mark the corresponding location in the moving image\n",
    "- Compute the translation as $t = x^{\\prime} - x$\n",
    "- Transform the moving image by translating it with $\\mathbf{-t}$\n",
    " \n",
    "It is therefore unrealistic to look for an algorithm that will find a transformation that results in a perfect alignment of all corresponding fiducial pairs. However, we can design an algorithm that will find a transformation that results in the best possible alignment given that fact that there will always be some error. The better an algorithm aligns the two views, the lower this error becomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "How to find the transformation that aligns fiducials at the lowest possible alignment error?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Write the error as a function of the transformation (affine registration)\n",
    "- Step 2: Find the minimum of the error function w.r.t. the transformation \n",

    "The term ''image transformation'' refers to the transformation of pixel spatial coordinates. Images are stored as arrays of values where each corresponds to a pixel intensity. In addition to the intensity, in medical imaging, each pixel is associated with spatial coordinates (these are in some world coordinate system where the pixel intensity value appears), and extent (the physical extent of a pixel). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercises below, we assume that the pixel indices correspond to the spatial coordinates. Moreover, we assume that all images have pixels of the same size and shape (unit size isotropic). Unlike in these exercises, the concepts of physical pixel size and spatial coordinates are vital in practice. \n",

    "3. Determine the intensity value at those locations with image interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous exercises you have implemented functions for computing transformation matrices and applied them to geometric objects. In these exercises you will first write a Python function that performs image transformation by the inverse mapping method. Then, you will implement a function that performs linear least squares fitting. All necessary information for implementing these functions can be found in the lecture slides. You can use the functions that you implement in this section to perform point-based affine image registration in the project work."

    "### 2.1 Inverse mapping\n",
    "Transforming an image results in transforming the locations of the image pixels. The most obvious method for transforming an image is to apply the geometric transformation to all pixel locations in an input image (the image that is being transformed) in order to determine where those pixel should be located in the output image (the transformed image) and then \"fill in\" the corresponding intensity values. This approach is called _forward mapping_ and is illustrated in the figure below.\n",

    "The forward mapping method can be problematic as some pixels in the output image might not \"receive\" a value (resulting in gaps), while some pixels might \"receive\" multiple values (resulting in overlaps) from the input image. These problems can be avoided by using an approach called _inverse mapping_ illustrated in the figure below. Inverse mapping works by transforming the locations of the output image back to the original image by applying the inverse of the geometric transformation. The values for the pixels of the transformed image can be obtained by interpolation at the determined location in the original image. This avoids the problem of gaps and multiple values of the forward mapping method.\n",
