    "The dataset you will be using in the first mini-project originates from the [MRBrainS medical image analysis challenge](http://mrbrains13.isi.uu.nl/). It consists of 30 traverse slices of MR brain scans with two different sequences: T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR (5 patients $\\times$ 3 slices per patient $\\times$ 2 modalities). Please see the [Getting started](#getting_started) assignment below for more details on the dataset.\n",

The following report structure is suggested for the main body of the report:\n",

    "The introduction and result sections can be very brief in this case (e.g. half a page each). The discussion section should contain the analysis of the results. The report must be submitted as a single PDF file. The code must be submitted as a single archive file (e.g. zip or 7z) that is self-contained and can be used to reproduce the results in the report. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no single correct solution for the project. You have to demonstrate to the reader that you understand the methods that you have studied and can critically analyze the results of applying the methods. Below, you can find a set of assignments (guided project work) that will help you get started with the project work and, when correctly completed, will present you with a **minimal solution**. Solutions which go beyond these assignments are of course encouraged.\n",

The image filenames have the following format: `{Patient ID}_{Slice ID}_{Sequence}.tif`. For example, the filename `3_2_t1.tif` is the second slice from a T1-weighted scan of the third patient. Every T1 slice comes in two versions: original and transformed with some random transformation that can be identified with the `_d` suffix in the filename. This simulates a registration problem where you have to register two image acquisitions of the same patient (note however that some of the transformations that were used to simulate the second set of images are not realistic for brain imaging, e.g. brain scans typically do not encounter shearing between consecutive acquisitions).\n",
