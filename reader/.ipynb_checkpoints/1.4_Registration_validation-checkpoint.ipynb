    "##  1. Probability theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random variables\n",
    "Random variables map the outcomes of random phenomena to numbers. Remember the example with coin tossing in the lecture? There, we had a random variable $X$ (outcome of the coin toss), and another random variable $Y$ (the number of heads in a series of 3 tosses). To represent possible values and the respective probabilities of the magnitude of a random variable, we use probability distribution functions. In a similar way, we can define medical image intensities as random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability mass function (a.k.a probability distribution table)\n",
    "Random phenomenon: Pick a random pixel location. In this case, the pixel intensity can be treated as a random variable. Each outcome from the random phenomenon we are studying can be associated with a probability. If a random variable $X$ can have a finite set of possible values, we can define a function that maps each possible value to a probability. This function is called **probability mass function** (PMF), and expresses a *discrete probability distribution*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probability mass function: \n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{X}(x) = P(X = x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\"><img src=\"../reader/assets/pmf.png\" width=\"500\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=\"1\">Figure from [Fong Chun Chan's Blog](https://tinyheero.github.io/2016/03/17/prob-distr.html)</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we have two random variables? For example, the pixel intensity in two images. In such case, we can define a joint probability mass function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X = x, Y = y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF can be used to determine the probability of an observation being exactly equal to a discrete target value. But how can we define the probability mass function for the image intensities? We can use image histogram for this purpose by counting the number of occurrences of each intensity value in the image. In order to treat the counts of the histogram as probability values, we must normalize the histogram in such a way that all values sum to 1. This is the probability mass function for the pixel intensity as a random variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability density function\n",
    "Probability mass function is defined for discrete random variables. In case of continuous random variables, however, their probabilities are not directly measurable, and we therefore calculate the probability as the proportion of times. Imagine you had a random variable that measured the price of a diamond. Now, what is the probability that a single diamond's price is exactly equal to e.g. 150 USD? The probability of getting a diamond for that exact price would be very low, if any at all. Therefore, a given value of a variable on a continuous scale cannot be assigned a probability. We therefore need to think in terms of intervals instead of individual outcomes. For continuous random variables, which can take infinite number of possible values, we can define the **probability density function** (PDF), where the probability of $y \\in [a,b]$ is equivalent to the integral of the PDF between $a$ and $b$:\n",

    "###  Bayes’ rule \n",
    "Bayes’ rule is a very useful formula that we will use later in the computer-aided diagnosis notebooks of this course. \n",
    "The so-called Bayes' theorem gives the probability of an event based on new information that is, or may be related, to that event. Mathematically, the Bayes' theorem can be expressed as follow: \n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{X|Y} = \\frac{p_{Y|X}(x|y)p_{Y}(y)}{p_{X}(x)}$   ,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ and $Y$ are events and $P(Y) \\neq 0$, and:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p_{X|Y}$ is the probability of event $X$ occurring given event $Y$ is true; also known as the posterior probability of $X$ given $Y$\n",
    "- $p_{Y|X}(x|y)$ is the likelihood of $X$ given a fixed $Y$\n",
    "- $p_{X}(x)$ and $p_{Y}(y)$ are the probabilities of observing the two events without any given conditions; also known as marginal or prior probabilities\n",
    "- $X$ and $Y$ are events (must not be the same)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is typically utilized in diagnostic decision-making, e.g. to find out if there is a certain clinical manifestation in a patient before images are acquired. Given the prevalence of a disease, a radiologist is able to first estimate the marginal probability of the disease and afterwards assess medical images based on this prior. The Bayes' rule enables to derive positive predictive and negative predictive values in radiologists' pre-assessment tasks. Furthermore, this probability theorem also has its utility in cases with similar imaging findings in different diagnoses to calculate the probability at which certain imaging characteristics pertain to rare or common diagnoses (regardless of complete clinical contexts). The Bayes' theorem is also used in algorithms for medical image artefact corrections, such as in MRI and perfusion-weighted images to reduce noise. Bayesian inference has a wide range of applications in AI-driven radiology software."
