    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "The ultimate goal of any classification/segmentation technique is to use training data to make accurate predictions about future, unlabeled data. In other words, the goal is to *generalize* well to new data. This can be achieved by many different choices for classifiers and many different combinations of features. For example, when tasked with predicting the systolic blood pressure of a patient given some clinical data, we could use many different clinical values: the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) blood levels of the patient, their high-level lipoprotein (HDL), but also their age, weight and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing which combination of features to use for a classifier is a non-trivial task, for a variety of reasons:\n",
    "* For most complex tasks, it is inherently unclear what number of features is 'enough'.\n",
    "* It may not always be intuitive what features are actually discriminatory between your classes.\n",

    "### Curse of dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth elaborating on the last point: increasing the number of features may inadvertedly lower classifier performance. This is because of something called the *curse of dimensionality*. We can illustrate the curse of dimensionality with a simple example, where we try to classify pictures of dogs from cats using a linear classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below, we show how the feature space of the classifier grows by adding one new feature (dimension) at a time. You can image that we might begin by classifying dogs from cats by their color, but we find that this doesn't offer a linear seperability of our dataset (there is no one line we can draw that perfectly seperates the two animals). We see the same for two features (e.g. color and size). However, when we use three features (e.g. color, size and weight), we *can* linearly seperate the two classes, thus giving us perfect classification accuracy!\n",

    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center\"> <b>Figure 2:</b> The more features we use, the higher the likelihood we can seperate the classes with a hyperplane. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "While it looks like adding more features has improved classification performance, **this is actually not the case**. Consider the 'density' of all of the training samples (represented by cat/dog icons) within the feature space: as the number of dimensions goes up, the feature space becomes increasingly sparse. As you might intuitively feel, it is much easier to find a hyperplane that splits two classes perfectly in a sparse feature space than in a very densely filled feature space - there are simply far less constraints on what shape the hyperplane needs to take on. In fact, if you were to take an infinite amount of features, the probability of a training sample laying on the wrong side of a hyperplane would become infinitely small and your classification performance on the training samples would be perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the curse of dimensionality causes **overfitting** on the training set: the learned hyperplane does not reflect actual real-world differences between cats and dogs (the test set), but instead reflects the appearance of individual cats and dogs that just happen to appear in our training set. In this instance, a much better choice would be to do linear classification on two features: while performance on the training set would be lower, the model would *generalize* much better to the new, unseen data of the test set."

PCA becomes much more useful for datasets where there are too many features to plot in a human understandable way. In that case, we can select only a subset of the first $n$ eigenvectors of matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ (principal components) to do our transformation with. This means we project the data onto fewer axes and get a lower dimensional dataset! For example, if we have a 100-dimensional dataset and we choose $n = 10$, we only take the first 10 columns of $\\mathbf{U}$ and use this $\\mathbf{U_{\\text{reduced}}}$ to project 100 dimensions onto 10 dimensions.\n",
